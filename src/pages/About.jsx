        <h2>About Rocks</h2>
        <p>
          Some people consider minerals and rocks to be life forms due to their
          role in complex, self-organizing processes. This perspective comes
          from certain interpretations of life that extend beyond biological
          organisms. Minerals and rocks undergo processes such as growth,
          crystallization, and transformation over time, which some interpret as
          similar to the self-organization seen in living systems. Additionally,
          minerals play a vital role in Earth's ecosystems and the evolution of
          life, contributing to the idea that they are an integral part of the
          broader concept of life. This view often aligns with ideas in systems
          theory, Gaia theory, or deep ecology.
